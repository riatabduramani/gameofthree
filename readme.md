### GameOfThree - Coding Challenge
The goal is to implement a game with two independent agents – the "players" – communicating with each other using an interface.

### How to play?
Get the files and add to your php environment, open two terminals and run the file: <pre> $ php play.php </pre>

The game will be created automatically if no channels are available, and the other terminal will be asked to join this game by entering the channel id.

######<i><b>Cheers!</b></i>
