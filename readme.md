### GameOfThree - Coding Challenge
The goal is to implement a game with two independent agents – the “players” – communicating with each other using an interface. When a player starts, a random whole number is generated and sent to the other player, which indicates the start of the game. The receiving player must now add one of <code> { -1, 0, 1 } </code> to get a number that is divisible by 3 and then divide it. The resulting number is then sent back to the original sender. The same rules apply until one of the players reaches the number 1 after division, which ends the game.

### How to play?
Get the files and add to your php environment, open two terminals and run the file: <pre> $ php play.php </pre>

The game instructions will be shown when you will call the above mentioned file.
